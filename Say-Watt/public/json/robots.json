    "content": "Our robot represents human ingenuity, but is relatively simple, as we are middle schoolers. Our robot uses linear slides and a pointed rod that sticks into the cones and majestically lifts cones onto the yellow poles.It uses mechnum wheels to quickly maneuver around the field, in any direction. We hope you will get to see us do well in this competition. The robot has many quirks, including speed, precision and being well developed."
